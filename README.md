# Evergarden Letters

A mini-message board inspired from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-mini-message-board),
and themed after the anime [Violet Evergarden](https://anilist.co/anime/21827/).

âš  **README a work in progress.** Until the project is complete, the README will be updated as the project progresses.

**Ad-hoc thoughts for the time being:**

- The project is a mini-message board, where users can post messages and view them.
- This project is a part of the Odin Project's NodeJS curriculum.
- The project is inspired by the anime Violet Evergarden, and will be themed accordingly.
- This is my first interactive backend project, so I'm a bit excited for getting my hands dirty.
- Uses Expressjs, and Pug for templating. Why did I choose Pug? Because I've had some experience with EJS-like jinja2 templating in Flask, and I wanted to try something new, less lines of code. The Pug documentation was straightforward, and syntax resembles Python's indentation, so I don't think I'll have a hard time with it. (*finger's crossed*)
